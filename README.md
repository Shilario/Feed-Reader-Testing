# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

# How it works

This is a web application in which you could find 4 main topics for feed readers:

- Udacity Blog
- CSS Tricks
- HTML5 Rocks
- Linear Digressions

In the app you can choose between this topics and will display a list of feeds, in which by clicking in each one will redirect the reader to the page with the entire article attach to the title.
